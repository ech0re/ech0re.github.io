    <description><![CDATA[1. Introduction Warning  This post is intended for intermediate or experienced people, as I will not explain the basics of reverse engineering or exploitation.   This is probably the longest write-up you&rsquo;ll see on this blog. The reason is simple: I will show you the whole processus of vulnerability research, to full exploitation of a Windows OCX Controller, including failing paths (that are very interesting).
I will go from a simple CVE number, with no existing public exploit and not much information on the internet, to finding the vulnerability and exploiting it to run arbitrary code on the operating system.]]></description>
