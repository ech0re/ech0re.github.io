    <description><![CDATA[1. Introduction Warning This post is intended for intermediate or experienced people, as I will not explain the basics of reverse engineering or exploitation. This is probably the longest write-up you&rsquo;ll see on this blog.

I will go from a simple CVE number, with no existing public exploit and not much information on the internet, to finding the vulnerability and exploiting it to run arbitrary code on the operating system.]]></description>
